##Twin Primes
###Popular programming languages
This chart shows the execution time and CPU usage of the Twin Primes test for multiple popular programming languages based on n = 100,000 

![Different language performance](/images/diagram.png)

**Notes that could effect performance:**
- All - execution time could be reduced by up to 50% by iterating by two (i.e. 3,5,7 not 3,4,5) *(see PHP, C, Swift)*
- Java - ArrayList was used to store primes
- Objective-C - NSMutableArray was used to store primes, primes were stored as NSNumber

##Languages which can be compiled by Xcode7 without external compiler
_Doesn't include C++_
